{"count":38,"next":null,"previous":null,"results":[{"slug":"adult-wind-dragon","desc":"_Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._  \nWind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.","name":"Adult Wind Dragon","size":"Huge","type":"Dragon","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"chaotic neutral","armor_class":19,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":237,"hit_dice":"19d12+114","speed":{"walk":40,"fly":90},"strength":24,"dexterity":19,"constitution":22,"intelligence":16,"wisdom":15,"charisma":18,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":10,"constitution_save":12,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":8,"charisma_save":10,"perception":14,"skills":{"acrobatics":10,"intimidation":10,"perception":14,"stealth":10},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"","damage_immunities":"lightning","condition_immunities":"charmed, exhausted, paralyzed, restrained","senses":"blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 24","languages":"Common, Draconic, Primordial","challenge_rating":"17","cr":17.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The wind dragon can use its Frightful Presence and then makes three attacks: one with its bite, and two with its claws."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

They use local spiders as spies and informants to get closer to their quarries or discover dark secrets their quarries would rather keep hidden. Ever patient in their schemes of corruption, arachnocrats often court their quarries over months of theatre, dinner parties, and elaborate balls.  \n**Hidden in Plain Sight.** Arachnocrats are adept at disguising themselves as aristocrats. Their most noticeable features are their clawed hands and their spider-like faces, which they cover with gloves, masks, scarves, voluminous robes, and similar attire. The eccentricities of the well-to-do help to cast off any suspicion over their odd coverings.  \n**As Good As Gold.** The arachnocrat’s preferred prey comes at a high price.

Only the largest white dragons surpass the graknork in size and strength, and lesser creatures give the monster a wide berth. Graknorks are mostly found on land but are reasonable swimmers. They have no problem taking to the water to pursue escaping prey or to hunt fishermen and even whales. Graknorks are solitary creatures and cannot stand the presence of their own kind, attacking and eating juvenile graknorks that cross their path. When they do mate, it is a destructive affair with the female uprooting dozens of trees to build her nest. A typical graknork is more than forty feet long, though even larger specimens have been sighted in the coldest regions of the world.  \n**Great Blue Eye.** While the graknork’s raw physical prowess is justifiably feared, the aspect of its appearance that causes the greatest consternation is its great, freezing blue eye. Its eye is said to possess terrible and wondrous powers, including seeing through illusions, freezing souls outright, and causing everlasting blizzards.

Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight._  \n**Foe to Reptilians.** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.  \n**Swamp Guides.** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they don’t have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.  \n**Otter Trainers.** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars.

The daughter’s first action upon assuming power and control over the hive-city is to devour her mother and all her sisters.  \n**Hive Chaos.** If a hive-queen dies with no heir to anchor the hive mind, the city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hivemind go berserk. A few fortunate ones might escape and become lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the hive-queen’s daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.  \n\n## A Tosculi Hive-Queen’s Lair\n\n  \nHive-queens make their lairs in the most protected part of the hive. Huge corridors lead to this point, so all tosculi can reach their queen as quickly as possible. This is also the place where tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival of the hive. A tosculi hive-queen encountered in her lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP), but nothing else in her stat block changes.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n* The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.\n* A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies.\n* The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage).\n  \nThe tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.  \n\n## Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:  \n\\# Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It’s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads.  \n\\# Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:  \n**Blood Frenzy.** The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points.

Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.","name":"Young Wind Dragon","size":"Large","type":"Dragon","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"chaotic neutral","armor_class":17,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":150,"hit_dice":"16d10+62","speed":{"walk":40,"fly":90},"strength":20,"dexterity":19,"constitution":18,"intelligence":14,"wisdom":13,"charisma":16,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":7,"constitution_save":7,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":4,"charisma_save":6,"perception":7,"skills":{"perception":7,"stealth":7},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"","damage_immunities":"lightning","condition_immunities":"charmed, exhausted, paralyzed, restrained","senses":"blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 17","languages":"Common, Draconic, Primordial","challenge_rating":"6","cr":6.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
